OK NOW? - Failed with hello.rb when it had no requires because the cp_r didn't like there being no vendor cache folder. ok non-serfs
OK NOW?  - at moment has a require in place
DONE: - Bigger unzip buffer
DONE: - Fix silly crash when no args
DONE: - require of rexml => include goes to wrong object

- Need to implement Dir[] for *.dll copies
- Fix the load/wrap issue
- Include vendorize
- Only add gzip decoder if needed
- Split program.cs into 2 files so that program.cs passes args to secondary.
  That way can more easily intercept args in program and only pass, say, any
  after a '--' on to packaged app. Easier to support dogfood app options.
- Fully test/implement Serfs IO/File/Dir
- Backup needed on GitHub wikis?
