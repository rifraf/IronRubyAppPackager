h1. IRPackager

IRPackager is a Ruby library that packages a Ruby application into a standalone .exe file that embeds all of the application source, library and GEM files in embedded resources within the executable.

The executable runs using IronRuby.

Run-time dependencies:

* .Net version 2 needs to be installed on any PC that runs the executable
* IronRuby (though the DLLs can just be copied to the folder containing the executable)

Package-time dependencies

* "Serfs":http://github.com/rifraf/Serfs
* "IREmbeddedApp":http://github.com/rifraf/IronRubyEmbeddedApps/
* Vendorize
* .Net version 2
* (Optional) "ILMerge":http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/mbarnett/ILMerge.aspx

h2. Quick run-through

Given an existing Ruby application (that runs with IronRuby), just run @ir -rvendorize app.rb@.

This will copy any @require@ files into the folder @_vendor_@.

You can run the program several times with different options if the required files depend on the options.

Or just run your tests...

Then run IRPackager which will generate a C# project that embeds your source files and @_vendor_@ files. It will build the project and deliver you a nice shiny .exe file.
